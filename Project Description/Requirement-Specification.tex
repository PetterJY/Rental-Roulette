\section{Rental Roulette Ideas}

- You first choose the cities you want to pick up and drop off the car, along with the dates.
- Then, all the cars available for those dates and cities are displayed.

\subsection{Features:}

When a person places an order for a car on a specific date and city, this information is communicated to the back-end. The availability of that car is updated, ensuring no one else can rent it.

\subsection{Filters:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Price (range)
    \item Passengers
    \item Acceleration
    \item Top speed
    \item Sedan, SUV, cabriolet, familiebil, stasjonsvogn, elektrisk, luksus/sport
    \item Fuel Type
    \item Manual vs automatic
    \item Brand/car maker – Tesla vs Volkswagen
    \item Driver's age: the older, the cheaper it is (insurance).
    \item Model - 2008 vs. 2020
    \item Extra features: Bluetooth, DAB radio, heated seats
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mandatory Requirements – Common}
A complete website must be implemented. Both the frontend and backend must support the entire process of product filtering:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Landing page
    \item Product search (search form and search result list/grid)
    \item Choosing one specific product
    \item Product detail page (for the chosen product):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Product image
        \item Product description
        \item Product price for the different providers
    \end{itemize}
    \item Placing an order (this action may vary depending on the project theme; propose a solution and present it to the customer (teachers)).
    \item Login form
    \item For logged in users:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Regular users:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can add a product to their favorite list.
            \item Can see their favorite products.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Admin users:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can show and hide a product. A hidden product does not appear to regular users.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
